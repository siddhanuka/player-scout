Soccer players scout

This project is to scout soccer players for different soccer league clubs in Europe.

For example: the talent scout team of a soccer club is looking for a replacement of their player who has already signed a contract with another team mid-season. They need a player left footed or has left foot as the stronger foot, plays as left full back in his current team, a regular starter with atleast 30 games in which he has started, has atleast 5 assists and 1 goal, whose age is between 17 and 25, has value in market less than $25m and plays in either La Liga or Serie A. 

If we need to understand the needs of our team and better understand the prospective target who can potentially fulfill the gap and perhaps be a boost to the team as a whole, this project would help to list down potential players based on that criteria.
